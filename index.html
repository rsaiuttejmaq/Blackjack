                <h3>Blackjack Rules</h3>
                <p>Blackjack is a popular card game typically played in casinos. The objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Here are the basic rules:</p>
                
                <h4>Card Values</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</li>
                    <li>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.</li>
                    <li>Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Gameplay</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The game starts with each player receiving two cards. The dealer also receives two cards, with one card face up (the "upcard") and one card face down (the "hole card").</li>
                    <li>Players can choose to "hit" (take an additional card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).</li>
                    <li>Players can continue to hit until they choose to stand or exceed 21 points (bust).</li>
                    <li>If a player busts, they lose the round automatically.</li></li>
                    <li>Once all players have finished, the dealer reveals their hole card and must hit until they reach at least 17 points.</li>
                    <li>If the dealer busts, all remaining players win. If not, hands are compared to determine the winner.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>Winning</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win and are paid 1:1.</li>
                    <li>If you get a Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-point card) on your first two cards, you typically win 1.5 times your bet.</li>
                    <li>If the dealer's hand beats yours, you lose your bet.</li>
                    <li>If you tie with the dealer, it's a "push," and you neither win nor lose your bet.</li>
                </ul>
